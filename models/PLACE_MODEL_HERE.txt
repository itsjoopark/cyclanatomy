📦 3D MODEL INSTRUCTIONS
========================

Place your road bike 3D model files in this directory.

EXPECTED FILE:
- roadbike.glb (recommended - single file with embedded textures)
  OR
- roadbike.gltf + texture files

SUPPORTED FORMATS:
- .glb (Binary GLTF - preferred)
- .gltf (JSON GLTF with separate textures)

FILE NAMING:
The app.js file is configured to look for: "roadbike.glb"

If your model has a different name, either:
1. Rename your model to "roadbike.glb"
2. Update the CONFIG.modelPath in app.js

MODEL FROM YOUR REFERENCE:
You mentioned: "roadbike__bicycle_canyon_endurace_cf"

Please place the Canyon Endurace CF bike model files here.

TEXTURE FILES:
If using .gltf format, place all associated texture files in this same directory:
- Base color/diffuse maps
- Normal maps
- Metallic/roughness maps
- Any other material textures

The GLTFLoader will automatically find textures if they're in the same directory.

TESTING:
After adding the model, run a local server from the project root:
  python3 -m http.server 8000

Then open: http://localhost:8000

The model should load and be visible in the center of the scene with mouse controls enabled.
